    <h1>Information about Amanda Ezeobiejesi</h1>
    <p>
      I am a senior at WPI and this past summer, I interned at a multinational financial services corporation, 
      Fidelity Investments. I worked on creating user interfaces for several web applications using the Angular 
      platform. The previous summer I built a business website from scratch, which is where I really started getting 
      involved with full stack development. What I did that summer as well as my internship, helped me realize that 
      I have a passion for web development and it is defeinitly the career path I want to follow with my degree.
