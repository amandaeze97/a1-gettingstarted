      <p>
        I am a senior at WPI and this past summer, I interned at a financial services corporation, 
        Fidelity Investments. I worked on creating user interfaces for several web applications using the Angular 
        platform. The previous summer, I built a website from scratch, which is where I really started 
        getting involved with full stack development. What I did that summer as well as my internship, helped me 
        realize that I have a passion for web development and it is definitly the career path I want to follow 
        with my degree.

        I am majoring in Computer Science.
